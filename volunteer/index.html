        I volunteer in bible based education (aiding interested ones in learning from the bible). I
        find this to be a refreshing and rewarding use of my time. It is helpful to others and
        continues to strengthen and build my faith as well.

        I have also volunteered in building projects. I had many opportunities to help build
        Kingdome Halls in Michigan. For each project the majority of the work was done in a weekend
        (meaning starting on Thursday with just a foundation and ending on Sunday with only
        finishing touches left to be done). These project were amazing. The fellowship and
        togetherness was uplifting. Even the hard work was fun. This also gave me some valuable
        experience as I learned how to install ceiling grids and electrical items.

        Additionally, I had the opportunity to volunteer for a week in Mississippi after hurricane
        Katrina where I was part of a team that reinstalled roofs on homes damaged in the storm. Our
        team managed about 7 roofs that week, a couple were quite large. Before that trip I had
        never been on a roof, let alone installed one (Iâ€™m afraid of open heights!) Although it was
        sad to see all the destruction and what people were dealing with it was still a wonderful
        experience in many ways.
