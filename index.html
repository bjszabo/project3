        <p>
          I am an electrical designer with experience in a variety of electrical applications from
          commercial to utility/industrial. I also have some engineering experience and am gearing
          my career more towards the engineering aspect of electrical design in power generation and
          distribution. I am looking to stay within the utility and/or commercial industries and
          utilize my combined design/engineering experiences to explore new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with my goal of transitioning towards more engineering in my  career I’ve been
          pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on power  systems and
          distribution. This type of focus falls in line with the experience I already have and the
          direction I want to go.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p class="direction">To view my Resume please click <a href="resume/">here.</a>
        <p>
          My work experience includes layouts of lighting, power, conduit, grounding, equipment and
          fire detection/notification systems. I utilize the NEC, NFPA, Life Safety Code, and numerous
          other building codes as well as company and client standards in creating the designs for the
          required systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I’ve done power analysis, fault current calculations, and lighting level
          calculations. These are done in order to determine designs meet requirements and/or to
          determine what may be needed in order to complete a proper design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are a couple of snapshots of portions of lighting designs I’ve worked on, one at a
          plant and one at a casino.
