        <p>
          I am an electrical designer with experience in a variety of electrical applications from
          commercial to utility/industrial. I also have some engineering experience and am gearing
          my career more towards the engineering aspect of electrical design in power generation and
          distribution. I am looking to stay within the utility and/or commercial industries and
          utilize my combined design/engineering experiences to explore new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with my goal of transitioning towards more engineering in my  career I’ve been
          pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on power  systems and
          distribution. This type of focus falls in line with the experience I already have and the
          direction I want to go.

      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p class="direction">To view my Resume please click <a href="resume/">here.</a>
        <p>
          My work experience includes layouts of lighting, power, conduit, grounding, equipment and
          fire detection/notification systems. I utilize the NEC, NFPA, Life Safety Code, and numerous
          other building codes as well as company and client standards in creating the designs for the
          required systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I’ve done power analysis, fault current calculations, and lighting level
          calculations. These are done in order to determine designs meet requirements and/or to
          determine what may be needed in order to complete a proper design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are a couple of snapshots of portions of lighting designs I’ve worked on, one at a
          plant and one at a casino.

      <h2>Volunteer Work</h2>
      <p>
        I volunteer in bible based education (aiding interested ones in learning from the bible). I
        find this to be a refreshing and rewarding use of my time. It is helpful to others and
        continues to strengthen and build my faith as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also volunteered in building projects. I had many opportunities to help build
        Kingdome Halls in Michigan. For each project the majority of the work was done in a weekend
        (meaning starting on Thursday with just a foundation and ending on Sunday with only
        finishing touches left to be done). These project were amazing. The fellowship and
        togetherness was uplifting. Even the hard work was fun. This also gave me some valuable
        experience as I learned how to install ceiling grids and electrical items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I had the opportunity to volunteer for a week in Mississippi after hurricane
        Katrina where I was part of a team that reinstalled roofs on homes damaged in the storm. Our
        team managed about 7 roofs that week, a couple were quite large. Before that trip I had
        never been on a roof, let alone installed one (I’m afraid of open heights!) Although it was
        sad to see all the destruction and what people were dealing with it was still a wonderful
        experience in many ways.
