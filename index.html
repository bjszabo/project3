        Additionally, I had the opportunity to volunteer for a week in Mississippi after hurricane
        Katrina where I was part of a team that reinstalled roofs on homes damaged in the storm. Our
        team managed about 7 roofs that week, a couple were quite large. Before that trip I had
        never been on a roof, let alone installed one (I’m afraid of open heights!) Although it was
        sad to see all the destruction and what people were dealing with it was still a wonderful
        experience in many ways.
