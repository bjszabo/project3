        I enjoy cross-stitch, crocheting, and knitting as relaxing activities during those rare
        moments I have to sit and relax. I like to find patterns or have patterns made from phots.
        Here are some examples of my work.

        Additionally, I love to read who-done-it type crime and mystery novels. One of my favorite
        authors is Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta series has had me intrigued for over 20
        years. I also very much enjoy the Kinsey Millhone series (an alphabet based series starting
        with “A is for Alibi”) by Sue Grafton. I’ve yet to complete either series but am in
        progress. Other authors I favor are Robin Cook, James Patterson, Tess Gerritsen, and Stephen
        King.

        Something else I find enjoyment in, when I have the time, is baking and cooking. I do like
        trying new recipes and altering them until they work best for me. With baking I tend to gear
        more towards chocolate recipes but I have tried others. Some yummy items can be seen in the
        photos below. When I do cook, I do it from scratch, no box mixes in my house. I also like to
        make my own BBQ sauce. I do not use a recipe for that so it comes out a bit different every
        time, which is nice for less monotony. Cooking/Baking for me is a nice way to relax, enjoy
        good food, and please my family and friends.
